# Maintaining your Capstone2020 Start-Kit App


# Introduction

* In this tutorial, I'll provide you with tips and best practices to help you maintain your Capstone2020 starter-kit based solution app.

* When testing your local development, we suggest using the [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) as a rapid test platform once you have your solution working the way your users expect, then deploy to your intended environment (OpenShift, Azure, AWS, etc). 

* How to Taking Control the Solution Code from Gov's master Repository to Your Repository


## How to Taking Control the Solution Code from Gov's master Repository to Your Repository

1. Navigate into our [solution repository](https://github.com/bcgov/CITZ-IMB-Capstone2020)


2. Create a fork for the solution app by clicking the "Fork" button in the upper right corner<br />

    ![Screenshot](./images/Fork.png)

3. Download the forked solution app in your local by following [build.md](./build.md)


4. (**Optional**) If you have Contributors, you also have to make the connection between your local and the master branch for the solution app. You have to check out is your local up-to-date with the master branch or not before you want to make a pull request. If you don't do so you might over-write others' work.

   * Checkout your remote URL, run following command in terminal:
   ```sh
   $ git remote -v
    origin  https://github.com/${your_repo}/CITZ-IMB-Capstone2020 (fetch)
    origin  https://github.com/${your_repo}/CITZ-IMB-Capstone2020 (push)
   ```

   * Adding an upstream URL, run following command in terminal:
   ```sh
   $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/bcgov/CITZ-IMB-Capstone2020.git
   ```
   * Checkout your remote URL again, run following command in terminal:
   ```sh
   $ git remote -v
    origin  https://github.com/${your_repo}/CITZ-IMB-Capstone2020 (fetch)
    origin  https://github.com/${your_repo}/CITZ-IMB-Capstone2020 (push)
    upstream        https://github.com/bcgov/CITZ-IMB-Capstone2020.git (fetch)
    upstream        https://github.com/bcgov/CITZ-IMB-Capstone2020.git (push)
   ```
   * To upstream your local solution code, run following command in terminal:
   ```sh
   $ git pull upstream master
    remote: Enumerating objects: 1, done.
    remote: Total 1 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 1
    Unpacking objects: 100% (1/1), done.
    From https://github.com/bcgov/CITZ-IMB-Capstone2020
    * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
    * [new branch]      master     -> upstream/master
    Already up to date!
   ```
5.  Change the [version number](https://docs.npmjs.com/updating-your-published-package-version-number), run one of the following commands in terminal:
* (Commit everything before you increment the version number)
    ```sh
   $ git add .
   $ git commit -m "initial commit"
   ```
   ```sh
   $ npm version patch
   $ npm version major
   $ npm version minor
   ```
6. Add your change(s), commit your change(s), and push your change(s) to your forked repository by running:
   ```sh
   $ git add .
   $ git commit -m "initial commit"
   $ git push
   ```
## How to Make a Pull Request From Your Forked Repository to Master Repository 

1. Compared with your forked repository, if the master repository is not update-to-date, your **forked repository** will look like following here. Click "Pull Request" to create a pull request from your forked repository to master

2. Click create new pull request<br />

    ![Screenshot](./images/pull2.png)

3. (**Until here is everything you have to do**)Add at least one reviewer<br />

    ![Screenshot](./images/reviewers.png)

4. Wait at least one admin reviewed your changes, until [pipeline finish deployment](./deploy.md), and finally, an admin will click the "merge" button

## How to deploy your local solution app to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for testing

### <ins>NOTICE</ins>: You can create a new project in Netlify directly use the solution repo in GitHub (by using webhooks); However, GitHub will keep throwing some security notification if your account has 2-factor authentication

1. Navigate to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

2. Login with Github/ GitLab/ Bitbucket/ Email

3. Assume your solution code works fine locally <br/>
   Testing by run following command in terminal:
   ```sh
   $ npm start
   ```

4. Run following command in your solution root folder ( the folder has package.json ). This command will generate a ./build folder under the root folder. The build folder has everything for deploying the product.
   ```sh
   $ npm run build
    > capstone2020@0.10.1 build E:\demo\CITZ-IMB-Capstone2020
    > react-scripts build

    Creating an optimized production build...
    Compiled successfully.

    777 B     build\static\js\runtime-main.9d16b1e1.js

    The project was built assuming it is hosted at /.
    You can control this with the homepage field in your package.json.

    The build folder is ready to be deployed.
    You may serve it with a static server:

    serve -s build

5. Click “Sites” in Netlify.

6. Drag ./build folder into the bottom of the “Sites” page. Netlify will automatically navigate to the project overview page after drag action.<br/>

7. The overview page will pop-up after deployment. Open the solution app by clicking the URL under the overview page.

# Debuging Tips:

As an experienced developer you will have your established approach to debugging often based on the tools you use. With the ever changing libraries and patterns keeping up with community best practices , using forums such as stackoverflow can help maintain your development and defect remediation velocity.

# Summary:

In this tutorial, we have shown you how to create a local repository, make your changes, and push to the Netlify environment before publishing to your intended deployment environment.

**<em>Remember to bump up your build version before deploying your code.</em>**
